VM is advancement to Physical Server
Container is advancement to VM



VIRTUALISATION:
Laptop is a physical server. here in one server one app can run but can’t utilize full capacity of that server.
so, to solve this hypervisor came (which do virtualization to make a logical isolations/separation of physical servers for creating VMs, 
ere OS for each VMs, in it we can run multiple applications) 
Each VM has their own OS, and again tightly separated. so, it is secure.

CONTAINERIZATION:
We have 100gb RAM & 100gb CPU, because of VIRUTALISATION (there is 4 VMs are there with 25gb ram and 25gb CPU) 
but EVEN though we shifted to VIRTUALISATION our app is using only 15gb,6 CPU in his best day and only 5gb of storage, 5 CPU in his worst day. 
It’s a waste of resources. & To Solve this issue containerization came.
VMs have a complete OS but Containers don’t have a complete OS.
